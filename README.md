## 🎧 From Radio Waves to Creative Systems  

It all started back in **2003**, when I won **second prize** at a regional radio and television host competition — while still a chemistry major.  
That early spark led me to a microphone, a studio, and eventually a lifelong fascination with sound and communication.  

I later joined **China Radio International’s Hit FM**, where I worked as a **DJ, reporter, and producer**.  
There, I hosted and created shows such as *“Hit the Road”* and *“Hit Morning Show”*, blending global music, culture, and travel stories.  
Through the “5 Spot” interview series, I had the chance to talk with artists like **Kobe Bryant, Mark Ronson, Avril Lavigne, Maroon 5, Eels, Suede, Far East Movement, Paul van Dyk**, and **Tiësto**.  

These years in broadcasting taught me what rhythm, structure, and storytelling truly mean — both in sound and in human connection.

## 🌏 Evolving Beyond the Studio  

My work took me across continents, from live radio to international media collaboration.  
Those experiences helped me understand how ideas move across languages, and how culture and technology shape each other.  

I began contributing to cross-border editorial projects and continued experimenting with creative formats that combine music, narrative, and design thinking.

🏆 **China Good Design Gold Award**  
🏆 **Plus X Award** (Germany)

## 🔗 Towards the Future  

In recent years, my focus has shifted toward **creative technology** — exploring how AI, sound design, and automation can expand artistic expression and improve human experience.  
I continue to experiment across fields: from generative media and interface design to audio-driven storytelling systems.
